        <title>I already had body dysmorphic disorder. Then my skin started changing color.</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One percent of Americans have vitiligo, the skin disorder made famous by Michael Jackson. I’m one of them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the third day of being locked in my apartment, it dawned on me that I would eventually have to step outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d finished off a box of cornflakes the day before. I was officially out of food, and I felt a gnawing pain at the bottom of my gut. This was hunger, the real kind, and I was left with little choice but to throw on a hoodie and head to the grocery store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I layered on as many clothes as I could, careful to avoid any mirrors. I shook as I got myself dressed, not from hunger or because I hadn’t slept the night before, but because I was afraid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was going outside. People were going to see me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My condition has a name: body dysmorphic disorder. It means obsessive preoccupation with a perceived defect in physical appearance. But I wouldn’t learn that until later. When I locked myself in my apartment for three consecutive days, it had no name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t, at that time, even a disorder. It was a series of concerns. It was squashing my ears against the sides of my head because I thought they stuck out and taking pictures of myself in profile to see how big my nose was. It was burning a dirt track around my parents’ house because I had to run until I wasn’t fat anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iocdf.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/BDD-Fact-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;Research on the subject&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is scarce, but BDD is a condition that some experts believe could affect at least one in every 200 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are seven things that might help you understand it a little better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;body-dysmorphic-disorder-is-an-obsession-with-a-flaw-that-may-not-even-exist&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Body dysmorphic disorder is an obsession with a flaw that may not even exist.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did I lock myself in my apartment? Because I thought my head was too big for my body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not as in, “I can’t find a hat that fits, ha ha.” As in, I believed I looked like a bobblehead toy; that my head was so huge that people would laugh if they saw me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in the back of my mind, I knew the facts of the situation. No one had ever made fun of me for having an oversize head. Even if the size of my head were an open secret, nobody had ever treated me differently because of it. But these facts didn’t matter: The moment I persuaded myself that I had a cartoon head, I became obsessed with it. It was the only fact that mattered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a person with BDD, each perceived defect becomes the new center of the world. Everything in life is reduced to an opportunity to either confirm or deny his worst fears. For me, this looked like asking my friends, as casually I could muster, “So, do you think I have a big head?” A question that almost always elicited a, “What?” or an, “Excuse me?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t help myself. I was obsessed. I was consumed. I knew how ridiculous I sounded, but the state of mind I was in compelled me to keep asking, even though I knew there was nothing anyone could say that would make me feel better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I knew that only I could see this flaw. But that didn’t make it any less real to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-use-rituals-to-cope-with-overwhelming-anxiety&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) We use rituals to cope with overwhelming anxiety&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from BDD, I suffer from generalized anxiety disorder, but even with that baseline, BDD produces anxiety more painful than any other I’ve experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my GAD leads to a panic attack, I can usually wait it out. If I can make it an hour, the feeling will pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the panic my BDD provokes can last for days. Sometimes it lasts for weeks. The anxiety feels more urgent than the general kind, more primal. The only thing that matters is that I fix this flaw. Until it’s fixed, I can’t go on living, no matter the costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My friends and family just didn’t want to hurt my feelings, my anxiety told me, so they couldn’t be trusted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some BDD sufferers go as far as radical plastic surgery to assuage this panic. More common, however, is attempting to cover up the flaw and live normally with it hidden. For me, this involved wearing chunky sweaters, oversize hoodies — anything that bulked up my body to a size I thought was more appropriate to my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “covering” let me function, but barely. I felt like I was walking on knife’s edge. One slip-up, one stray glance into the wrong mirror, one plausibly negative comment, no matter how casual, would be enough to destroy the fragile peace of mind my clothing gave me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I didn’t have to be out in public, I’d spend my time at home taking pictures. An embarrassing number of pictures. So many pictures that whenever I’d come down from an especially intense bout of anxiety, it would take me an hour to go through my phone and delete them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behaviors like these are what people with BDD call “rituals.” They exist out of necessity. The mind looks for ways to rid itself of the stress, for something it can tangibly do to get to a better place. Anyone who suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder will likely recognize this need for rituals. BDD acts in much the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without these rituals, there would be nothing to distract the mind from the pain of the persisting defect. In addition to spending several hours every day taking pictures, I also spent a considerable amount of time on my computer looking up ways to conceal my flaw. At the same time, I looked to confirm it: I sought out strangers online, people I thought would give me a frank answer. My friends and family just didn’t want to hurt my feelings, my anxiety told me, so they couldn’t be trusted. Internet strangers would tell me how big my head was, and then, somehow, I could fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bdd-goes-hand-in-hand-with-eating-disorders&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) BDD goes hand in hand with eating disorders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was overweight as a kid. I was biracial, too, and the combination left me with a body type that proved easy fodder for my middle school classmates. My ass was large, my chest was huge, my waist was small next to both of them, and so they would tease me for having the “body of a girl.” I learned to be ashamed of being seen, of taking up space, of looking the way I looked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mind made sense of this treatment by making it rational, even deserved: You are being bullied because you look hideous. If you looked different, people would be nicer to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was 16 the first time I purged. I would run several miles a day, so often that I burned a dirt track around my parents’ house with my feet. I starved myself. I got so thin that people were concerned. They asked if I was sick. They asked my mother if I was eating. They asked me if I was “manorexic.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took it all as a compliment. I would rather be sickly thin than fat. Even when it became painful to sit down because I had nothing between my skin and my bones, I was happy because I wasn’t heavy anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But self-loathing is fickle, and one day it flipped the script. I realized that I didn’t want to be skinny, because skinny wasn’t “manly.” I wanted to be muscular. I wanted to be bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I could only see my body as fat: Even at my thinnest I wanted to be thinner. Then, suddenly, it was sickly. Disgusting. I was so thin that my head looked huge on my body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new defect was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pictures-and-videos-are-everywhere-now--and-that-makes-it-so-much-worse&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Pictures and videos are everywhere now — and that makes it so much worse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t imagine that BDD has ever been easy, but I think it’s made harder by a world where Snapchat and selfies pervade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like everyone wants to take a picture these days. Everyone wants to remember every moment in film. But film and photographs, like mirrors, are the enemies of anyone with BDD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It tends to go one of two ways: Either you completely avoid your own image, or you’re obsessed with it. You avoid the mirror, or you never stop looking in it. You take no pictures, or you take a thousand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If forced to confront their reflection, people with BDD are likely to spend enormous amounts of time looking at it, searching for the flaw they know is there, trying to determine if it’s real or imagined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The endless scrutiny offers no clarity. For all the time I’ve spent looking at myself, I do not know what I look like. Every mirror, every photo, every video presents a different version of me. Sometimes my flaw is proven real. Sometimes it is there but not as bad as I believed it to be. Yet even this validation doesn’t help; it only sends me seeking out more mirrors and more photos in order to confirm my relief, and this only brings me back to finding my flaw again — bad as ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite, or perhaps due to, the obsession, I hate being photographed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No, please, I don’t like photos,” I say when one of my friends takes out their phone for a picture. “Please.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they take a picture anyway, I become incredibly hostile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I said I don’t like pictures. What about that do you not understand? I said &lt;em&gt;no.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am desperately trying to avoid a confrontation with my appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time I saw a video of myself, it was for work. I have a job in media, and I was asked to speak about an issue in front of a camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to push through. I didn’t want to be a bad employee. But in the end, when I had to watch and hear myself, it shattered me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked to the bathroom and stayed there for an hour. I cried. I spent time looking in the mirror, trying to rebuild an image of myself I could live with, looking for the flaws I hated so much. It wasn’t anyone’s fault. It’s living with BDD — I couldn’t stand to look at myself, but I needed to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bdd-is-underresearched-and-underdiagnosed&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) BDD is underresearched and underdiagnosed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BDD can have drastic consequences beyond the day-to-day pain of the condition. Some consider suicide. In the depths of one of my episodes, I told myself I couldn’t live like this the rest of my life, that if I had to feel this way, even occasionally, it wasn’t worth going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite these risks, studies of BDD remain scarce, and information is difficult to find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite how common it’s now believed to be, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1414653/&quot;&gt;it often goes undiagnosed and underrecognized.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we do know is that most people with BDD suffer from other mental disorders simultaneously, the most common of which are depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When an official diagnosis made me more aware of my illness, I tried to seek out a community. But this proved difficult: The very nature of the disease makes people uncomfortable with being forthcoming. They worry it might draw attention to their perceived flaw. Doing so right now, even in a relatively lucid state of mind, is a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disease is also difficult to diagnose in men, who are far less likely to admit that they have an eating disorder or that they struggle with their appearances. That was a fear I had. According to all the societal messages I’d received, men weren’t supposed to have mental illnesses, and they certainly weren’t supposed to be worried about the way they look. At the height of my suffering, when I locked myself in my apartment for three days, I was still in the closet. I was terrified of being associated with anything people might see as feminine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite the “unmanliness” of worrying about one’s appearance, men still receive daily messages about what the ideal man is supposed to look like: tall, a head full of hair, muscular, and rugged. The result is a perfect storm. Men suffer from BDD, but don’t want to talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s how it was for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The limited research we do have, however, shows that men and women are about equally likely to have the disease. If we want more people to seek treatment, we must push for more research and examine how our society induces the terror of physical imperfection, then discourages its victims from seeking help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;therapy-and-medication-offer-hope-but-not-a-cure&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6) Therapy and medication offer hope, but not a cure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve painted a pretty grim portrait of BDD. But I must stress that there is hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been shown to be effective in treating BDD. I take Zoloft and a mood stabilizer. More research is required before we know the best drugs for this particular illness, but &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2705931/&quot;&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that symptoms do improve after patients go on medication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s okay that I’m feeling this right now, but I know I don’t have to feel this way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therapy is also important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the most effective form of therapy has been dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), a form of cognitive behavioral psychotherapy that focuses on mindfulness, distress tolerance, and emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DBT has taught me how better to regulate the intense emotions that my dysmorphia can provoke. It has also taught me how I can acknowledge the pain I feel and the visceral reaction my body has to my BDD while also acknowledging the facts: I am having this reaction because of my illness. It’s okay that I’m feeling this right now, but I know I don’t have to feel this way. I know that it will pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness, the practice of being present in the moment, has also proved to be very useful in my fight with BDD. Exercises vary, but one I find helpful is picking out an object and listing facts about it. This table is made of wood. This table is brown. This table has four legs. This helps me anchor myself more firmly in reality and keeps me from straying too far into obsessive, abstract fears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treatment hasn’t cured me. But it has helped me achieve a sort of agnosticism about my appearance. I have a body. My body is just fine. My body isn’t the most important part of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;there-are-good-ways-to-be-there-for-someone-with-bdd--and-bad-ways&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7) There are good ways to be there for someone with BDD — and bad ways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t tell someone with BDD that her flaw doesn’t exist. We know. If we don’t, it’s because that flaw has become the most basic fact of our universe. Neither case is helped much by debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But being there for a friend or loved one with the disorder isn’t impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t tell you how many phone calls I’ve had with my mother while I was going through an episode. She didn’t tell me that my flaw wasn’t there — that wouldn’t have helped — but she did remind me that my pain stemmed from a mental illness. She helped me take my mind off the flaw and redirect my focus onto the facts of my situation. And that’s perhaps the best thing you can do for people with BDD: help take their mind off it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time I had an episode, a friend asked if I wanted to take a walk. We went outside, away from my bathroom mirrors and to a place where I couldn’t take any photos, and we talked for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can also be vital to take people with BDD away from their triggers, to ask them what might set them off and help them avoid it. If they don’t want their picture taken, if they don’t want one of their physical features discussed, if being in a certain kind of environment makes them uneasy, those requests should be respected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communicating and respecting these requests might seem small to a person without BDD, but they could save a person with BDD from several hours of anxiety, pain, and wasted time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a friend or loved one feels like she might have BDD, encourage her to seek help. As with any mental illness, self-diagnosis is not suggested. Once BDD is diagnosed, that person can move forward in seeking ways to treat it, and I speak from personal experience when I say that a little bit of treatment can go a long way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a poorly understood disease. It is discussed so rarely that it is often mistaken for something else entirely: vanity, or OCD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we can all do right now is help start a dialogue about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I locked myself in my apartment for three days, nothing was more terrifying than the prospect of stepping outside where people could see me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I am healthy enough to write about my illness, to discuss my perceived flaw where everyone can read it, and to do so without sacrificing my peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progress is possible. Like most things, the first step is the hardest.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Backing for the wall spells the end of Republican decency</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To say that the GOP has been hijacked by Donald Trump would be too generous. The party’s establishment is now fully complicit in his bigotry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump’s massive, “very serious” wall, which continues to change in projected height depending on who Trump is talking to and how he is feeling about Mexico on any given day, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/18/mexico-border-wall-trump-republican-platform&quot;&gt;made it&lt;/a&gt; into the official Republican party platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The border wall must cover the entirety of the southern border and must be sufficient to stop both vehicular and pedestrian traffic,” the document reads. The platform was ratified on the floor of the Republican national convention in Cleveland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, the Republican party, ostensibly a “very serious” organization, has given its formal blessing to the xenophobic pipe dream that has been the centerpiece of Trump’s campaign from the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say “pipe dream” because the staggering amount of resources and labor it would require to build such a wall plants the project firmly in the realm of the implausible, if not the impossible. The Republican party probably knows this, and apparently the Republican party doesn’t care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, for Trump, it’s never been about whether or not he can actually fulfill the promises he makes. He only cares about being heard when he makes them. The more outlandish, the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A proposed travel ban on Muslims galvanized his base, but when it was continually pointed out that it was in direct violation of the Constitution, Trump quietly reneged, saying it was “just a suggestion”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he has failed to provide clear solutions for the many logistical obstacles to building the wall. But to Trump, this is immaterial. He has never once let facts get in the way of his narrative, and he’s not about to start any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguing the humanity of those who would be affected by this wall and the anti-immigrant language that accompanies it in the official party platform (it calls Barack Obama’s executive orders on immigration in 2012 and 2014 “unlawful amnesties” that must be rescinded) to Trump and his ardent supporters is a waste of breath. We in the Latino community know exactly where they stand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now, with the ratification of this platform, we know that the Republican party stands with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The platform is meant to reflect the soul of the party. In Cleveland, it became clear that this is now officially the party of Trump. If there ever was a Republican party that stood against xenophobia and racism, then that party has fallen, and it’s not just the newly empowered fringe that’s to blame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, many Republicans has tried to convince skeptics that the stereotypes weren’t true. The GOP wasn’t the party of bigotry. It wasn’t the party of racism or sexism or homophobia. These were lies from the left, meant to divide people and scare them away from conservative values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when a demagogue who was open in his contempt for immigrants and flagrant in his disdain for women came along with promises of a huge, impossible wall, the GOP caved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be ashamed of itself. What once claimed to be the party of Lincoln has surrendered its soul to a blowhard from reality TV, to a man they don’t even trust with access to a Twitter account, much less to nuclear launch codes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say that the party has been hijacked would be too gentle an assessment. Establishment Republicans are complicit in sewing the seeds of bigotry that would later bloom into Trumpism. They have helped to cultivate a culture of paranoia, a coalition of followers who are impervious to facts and act out of fear and anger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the kind of people you can sell a 2,000-mile wall to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is the case with Trump himself, there is precious little substance here. The party platform does not go into specifics. It does not submit a timeline for construction or a budget for the mammoth costs it will incur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It exists instead as a cultural affirmation, as an assertion of identity: we are the party that builds walls.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Republican platform is extremist – and so is anyone who supports it</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It endorses ‘conversion therapy’. It rejects marriage equality. Incredibly, it’s to the right of Donald Trump. This is a party that has abandoned the mainstream&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“While activists like to claim that pedophilia is a completely distinct orientation from homosexuality, evidence shows a disproportionate overlap between the two,” Tony Perkins wrote on the Family Research Council website &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/tony-perkins&quot;&gt;in 2010&lt;/a&gt;. “It is a homosexual problem.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such views are perhaps to be expected from the president of the FRC, a fiercely anti-LGBTQ organization that, using faith as a justification, has propagated the insidious view that gay people are sexual predators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mainstream Republicans might deem Perkins a fringe character. At the very least, they would probably want to distance themselves from a man who once purchased &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/picture-worth-thousand-memories&quot;&gt;Klansman David Duke’s email list&lt;/a&gt; for use in a political campaign in Louisiana (Perkins now claims he wasn’t aware of the mailing list’s connection to Duke).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, it’s Perkins and his ilk who have emerged as the GOP’s moral compass in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.advocate.com/election/2016/7/11/republican-platform-takes-stands-against-restroom-access-ex-gay-therapy&quot;&gt;crafting the party platform&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the national convention in Cleveland. Perkins, an RNC delegate from Louisiana, succeeded in his push to add language to the platform supporting “conversion therapy”, a practice banned in several states that “re-educates” children to become cisgender and heterosexual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the platform, which was approved in committee on Tuesday, supports state laws that bar transgender people from public bathrooms and includes language that says “natural marriage”, marriage between a man and a woman, is more likely to produce offspring who do not become addicted to drugs. It also declares pornography a “public health crisis”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Republican moderates failed in their bid to include language acknowledging anti-gay discrimination in the wake of the Pulse massacre in Orlando, and so the platform heads to a formal vote next week bereft of any positive language on LGBTQ people whatsoever. It is unclear if the party will ratify it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is clear, however, is the influence of anti-LGBTQ fanatics and radical social conservatives in drawing up the platform, one that, incredibly, veers right of the party’s presidential nominee, Donald Trump, who desperately needs the support of the religious conservatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perkins is far from the only anti-LGBTQ activist who had a hand in creating the platform. The committee also includes David Barton from Texas, who has claimed that HIV/Aids is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/barton-suggest-we-cant-cure-aids-because-it-punishment-sin&quot;&gt;God’s punishment for homosexuality&lt;/a&gt;, and Cynthia Dunbar from Virginia, who &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/ted-cruzs-virginia-co-chair-tied-evolution-and-gay-rights-holocaust&quot;&gt;compares gay rights to Nazism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a dream team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The support for conversion therapy is especially heinous, considering it’s LGBTQ children who are typically the people who undergo it. Children cannot consent to this dangerous practice, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hrc.org/resources/the-lies-and-dangers-of-reparative-therapy&quot;&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt; tell us that those who endure it are more likely to suffer from depression and are eight times more likely to have attempted suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same-sex marriage, of course, became the law of the land last year after the supreme court handed down its ruling on Obergefell v Hodges. But it’s an issue social conservatives are unwilling to let go of. Donald Trump himself claimed that he would “strongly consider” appointing supreme court justices who would overturn marriage equality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put together, the platform is an expression of the desire for LGBTQ people to disappear. It’s so bad that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/gay-south-florida/article89235362.html&quot;&gt;Log Cabin Republicans&lt;/a&gt; came out and called it the Republican party’s “most anti-LGBT platform in the party’s 162-year history”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sits in stark contrast to the Democratic party’s platform, which, while criticised by some for not doing more (the section on LGBTQ rights is a scant, singular paragraph), does take a strong stance on equality and says the party will fight for comprehensive federal non-discrimination protections for LGBTQ Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the Republican party platform isn’t just retrograde. It’s dangerous. It is the byproduct of the chaos presided over by an inexperienced, weak nominee, and it represents a stunning defeat for Republican moderates in the battle for the soul of their party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, any moderate who gives even tacit approval to a party that has positioned itself so squarely in opposition to the freedoms of LGBTQ cannot be considered a moderate at all.&lt;/p&gt;
