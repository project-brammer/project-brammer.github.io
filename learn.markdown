## Hey John! This is where we house all instructions on how to use your new website.

---

[Login to your Admin Area](https://manage.siteleaf.com/sites/581e54fce2771c33c3a5a45e/collections/work){:target="_blank"}

Your admin area is where you will add work and edit all existing information. The link above takes you directly to the work section of the page, where you will do most of your uploading.

### Updating & adding portfolio pieces

[Go to Work Admin Area](https://manage.siteleaf.com/sites/581e54fce2771c33c3a5a45e/collections/work){:target="_blank"}

Your *Work* pages have several items that change the way they look, these items are outlined below:

* **tags** – these are the categories of your articles (i.e Politics, Opinion, etc.)

* **hero** – if you set this to *true* then it will become the first article on the homepage

* **featured** – if you set this to *true* then it will become one of the 4 articles on the home page

* **featured-number** – make this a number from 1-4 to control where it will show up in the grid of 4 home page articles

* **image** – this is the image that will be used for the article background

* **publisher** – this is the publication the article was originally on. I've added the logos of all the publications you mentioned in our original survey. **Note:** *you must only use the one word lowercase descriptor for the publication in order for this to work (i.e **guardian**, **vox**, **huffington**, **slate**, **buzzfeed**)*

* **original** – this is the link to the original article

* **quote** – this is a quote of your choice that will: *1. show up on the sidebar of the article* and *2. show up as the body whenever somebody shares the article. (in the case of Twitter, it will show up as the tweet with the link and 'via @jpbrammer')*
